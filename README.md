Abstract
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly embedded in higher education, necessitating robust audit methodologies to ensure ethical alignment and risk mitigation. This study examines emerging AI audit frameworks—including the Key AI Risk Indicators (KAIRI) model, the “AAA” audit principles, and the CRISP-ML(Q) lifecycle approach—alongside recent scholarly and regulatory methodologies. We focus on ethical compliance (ensuring AI tools reflect institutional values) and risk mitigation (preventing biased or opaque decision-making), while also exploring governance measures for oversight and accountability. Through a literature review and analysis of AI audit criteria, we provide step-by-step recommendations for integrating audits into higher education processes. Our findings offer a structured approach for universities to assess AI systems, covering ethical alignment, risk assessment, stakeholder engagement, continuous monitoring, and adaptive governance. We conclude with insights on institutionalizing AI audits to promote transparency, fairness, and accountability in higher education.
